This module does Fisher matrices  for CMB !!!


It should be build fir the camb_april14 verison do do lensed NG covariance


in abl_cmbfisher.py:

there is a class: camb_config(abl_cosmo.cosmology) that defines a camb setting
within this camb setting, one can compute the derivatives with respect to cosmological parameters, and unl/phi derivative for the NG cov.


directories:

ngcov:

ngcov/. : where the final covmat will be
ngcov/der/ where the unl/phi derivatives will be

parder:

parder/. : where dlen and dul will be



lmax's :


lmax in camb. l_max_scalar  in the camb param file and passed as an argument when calling fab.abl_cmbfisher.Camb_config(cc,cur_path). defauld value is 7000 (and k_max_s_ini=10000)


lmax_cosmo_der : size of the derivative of parameters as they are created and saved!



lmax_sum : maximun l, for the construction of the NG covmat, must be lower than l_max_scalar (default is 5000)


lmax_cov : size of the cov matrix.

lmax_file (default 6000): shape of the cl read and written from/to camd output files
