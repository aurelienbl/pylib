The idea of this module is to provide tools to easily convert Mangle polygion files to healpix masks.


First issue it coordinates. for this V1. we assume that the Mangle mask is alway in RA, DEC

But we want to be able to produce Healpix mask both in EQU and GAL.


Producing a EQU mask should be straightforward, nothing to do

For GAL., the coordinated of the centers of the pixels have to be converted in ra, dec, to be polyid-ed again the mangle file.
