This repository is a collection of some personal python tools. Please feel free to use them if you find them useful.



abl_lib.py and abl_lensing.py are costum libraries of frequent tools I used, many of them related to I/O of HEALPix objects.

ablcamb_lib and ablcamb_lib_inverted contains I/O routines for CAMB products.
